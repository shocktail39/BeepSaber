# Open Saber VR
This is a fork of [Beep Saber by NeoSpark314](https://github.com/NeoSpark314/BeepSaber) ported to Godot 4.3 and OpenXR (WIP)
(The OQ Toolkit is only partially ported/patched for it to work on Godot 4 with OpenXR, most features that are not used in this project will not work)

This fork tries to improve the experience and make it more of it's own game instead of just a demo.



This is a basic implementation of the beat saber game mechanic for VR using the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/) and the [Godot Oculus Quest Toolkit](https://github.com/NeoSpark314/godot_oculus_quest_toolkit). The main objective of this project is to show how a VR game can be implemented using
the Godot game engine.

The main target platform is the Oculus Quest but it should also work with SteamVR if you add the OpenVR plugin to the addons folder in the godot project.

Originally this game was (and still is) a demo game as part of the Godot Oculus Quest Toolkit. To keep the demo implementation small
this stand alone version was forked so that it can be changed and developed independent of the original demo.
